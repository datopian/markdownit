# How to use Markdown in Google Docs

Did you know that Google Docs has major markdown support? Most importantly (at least for me) you can copy and past from markdown -- this is great for moving content from or to systems that are [[Markdown Native]] like [[GitHub]], [[ChatGPT]], [[Discourse]], [[Obsidian]] etc etc.

**However, markdown support is disabled by default ü§Ø**. So you need to enable it ... here's how courtesy of the official instructions https://support.google.com/docs/answer/12014036?hl=en

## Enable Markdown Support

- On your computer, open a file in Google Docs, Google Slides, or Google Drawings.
- Go to **Tools and then Preferences**
- Check or uncheck the box next to "Enable Markdown‚Äù.

Wow, that was easy üòÖ

## Paste markdown into Google Docs

- Copy the Markdown content to your clipboard
- On your computer, open a document in Google Docs.
- Right-click and select Paste from Markdown. The Markdown will be converted to Google Docs content and be pasted.

## Copy Google Docs content as Markdown

- In Google Docs select the content you want to copy
- Right-click and select Copy as Markdown.

## You can also import and export markdown files

- Just download as markdown ...
- Or upload

However, frankly I prefer just copy/pasting markdown using the above techniques 99% of the time.

I personally don't use markdown *in* google docs that much. But I use the import/export features a lot when collaborating with other folks. e.g. i draft something in obsidian or in a github issue (in markdown) and then i need to collaborate with others or make a fancier version so i need to transfer to google docs ... paste from markdown support in gdocs is then a god-send.

conversely i've worked with some colleague on a product idea or a task in google docs and now i want to transfer to issue tracker in e.g. github ... copy as markdown is super helpful.

I also often find that for relatively rich textual output prompting chatgpt to give me markdown output and then pasting in gdocs gives greater fidelity than copying and pasting directly from chatgpt (especially the native app).
