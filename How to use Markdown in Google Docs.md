# How to use Markdown in Google Docs

Did you know that Google Docs has major markdown support? Most importantly (at least for me) you can copy and past from markdown -- this is great for moving content from or to systems that are [[Markdown Native]] like [[GitHub]], [[ChatGPT]], [[Discourse]], [[Obsidian]] etc etc.

**However, markdown support is disabled by default ü§Ø**. So you need to enable it ... here's how courtesy of the official instructions https://support.google.com/docs/answer/12014036?hl=en

## Enable Markdown Support

- On your computer, open a file in Google Docs, Google Slides, or Google Drawings.
- Go to **Tools and then Preferences**
- Check or uncheck the box next to "Enable Markdown‚Äù.

Wow, that was easy üòÖ

## Paste markdown into Google Docs

- Copy the Markdown content to your clipboard
- On your computer, open a document in Google Docs.
- Right-click and select Paste from Markdown. The Markdown will be converted to Google Docs content and be pasted.

## Copy Google Docs content as Markdown

- In Google Docs select the content you want to copy
- Right-click and select Copy as Markdown.

## You can also import and export markdown files

- Just download as markdown ...
- Or upload

However, frankly I prefer just copy/pasting markdown using the above techniques 99% of the time.
