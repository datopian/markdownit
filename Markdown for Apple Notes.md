Appled Notes unfortunately still does not support [[markdown]].

Typing `## My Title` will give you just that -- no nice conversion to Heading.

However, there is a solution, at least on desktop, in the form of the free plugin / app **ProNotes.app**: https://pronotes.app/

You just need to submit your email and you'll be emailed a download link.

## Pricing: free ðŸŽ‰ with a paid premium version

The basic version including all the markdown features is free ðŸŽ‰

If you want more features e.g. AI support or just want to support the app you can subscribe for ðŸ’° $7.99 a month
